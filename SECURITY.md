## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the NETCONF Memory Leak Analyzer seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 📧 Contact Information

**DO NOT** file a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please email:

- **Security Team**: security@example.com
- **Subject Line**: `[SECURITY] NETCONF Memory Analyzer - Brief Description`

### 🔍 What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve by exploiting this vulnerability
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for how to fix the issue
6. **Your Contact Info**: How we can reach you for follow-up questions

### 📝 Example Report Format

```
Subject: [SECURITY] NETCONF Memory Analyzer - SSH Key Exposure

Description:
SSH private keys may be logged in plain text when debug logging is enabled.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable debug logging with --log-level DEBUG
2. Configure device with SSH key authentication
3. Run device testing
4. Check log files for private key content

Impact:
An attacker with access to log files could obtain SSH private keys and gain unauthorized access to devices.

Affected Versions:
All versions from 1.0.0 to current

Suggested Fix:
Sanitize SSH key content before logging or exclude from debug output.

```

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Device Access
- **SSH Keys**: Store SSH keys securely and never log private key content
- **Passwords**: Never store passwords in plain text or log files
- **Device Credentials**: Use environment variables or secure credential stores
- **Network Traffic**: All device communication should use encrypted protocols

### Container Security
- **Privileged Access**: Minimize privileged container access
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce resource limits to prevent DoS
- **Container Isolation**: Ensure proper container isolation
- **Image Security**: Use trusted base images and scan for vulnerabilities

### Log Files
- **Sensitive Data**: Never log passwords, SSH keys, or other secrets
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to log files containing device information
- **Retention**: Implement appropriate log retention policies
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize sensitive data before logging

### Configuration Files
- **Credential Storage**: Never store credentials in configuration files committed to version control
- **File Permissions**: Set appropriate file permissions on configuration files
- **Template Safety**: Ensure configuration templates don't contain real credentials
- **Validation**: Validate configuration inputs to prevent injection attacks

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Credentials**: Use SSH keys instead of passwords when possible
2. **Network**: Run on trusted networks or use VPN connections
3. **Updates**: Keep the tool updated to the latest version
4. **Permissions**: Run with minimal required permissions
5. **Logs**: Regularly review and rotate log files

### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Code Review**: All security-related code must be reviewed
5. **Testing**: Include security tests in the test suite

## 🔒 Secure Development Guidelines

### Authentication
- Use strong authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper session management
- Support multi-factor authentication where applicable

### Authorization
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Validate permissions for all operations
- Use role-based access control where appropriate

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper key management

### Error Handling
- Don't expose system information in error messages
- Log security events appropriately
- Implement proper exception handling
